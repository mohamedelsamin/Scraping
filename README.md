# Scraping
This Python script uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape quotes from the website https://quotes.toscrape.com. It sends a GET request to the website, parses the HTML content, and extracts all the quotes by locating HTML elements with the class text. Each quote is then printed to the console.
